    <h1>A boids experiment</h1>

    <p>
        Boids ("bird-oids") is a simulation of flocking introduced in a paper by Craig Reynolds in 1987. It's an
        <em>agent-based model</em> where the computer simulates each individual bird using some simple rules,
        producing a complex flocking behaviour.
    </p>
    <p>
        The three rules are:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Birds will try to face in the same direction as birds near them, so they can move as a flock</li>
        <li>They'll try to keep a separation distance from each other, so they don't fly into each other</li>
        <li>They'll try to keep as close as they can to the middle of the flock, so they don't fly off alone</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        In this experiment, you're going to play with how strong these different rules are to see what happens to the flock.
